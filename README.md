# west-africa-terror-trends-1970-2020
A five-decade journey through the patterns of violence and perseverance in West Africa, told through data.
This repository presents a comprehensive data analysis report on terrorist attack patterns across West Africa between 1970 and 2020. The analysis uses a curated subset of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), publicly available on Kaggle, processed in Microsoft Excel. The insights derived are intended for stakeholders in national security, humanitarian response, research, and policy-making.
🧠 Project Objective

The goal is to identify trends, perpetrators, and spatial distributions of attacks in the West African region using data from 1970–2020, to inform practical recommendations for security planning and humanitarian efforts.

📌 Key Features

Time-based Analysis: Focused on peak years (2011–2020)

Country-Specific Trends: Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, Chad, Ghana, Benin

Perpetrator Profiles: Boko Haram, Fulani extremists, separatist groups

Attack Methods: Armed assault, bombings, hostage situations

Target Entities: Civilians, military, government institutions

🗃 Dataset Source

Source: Kaggle - Global Terrorism Database (GTD)

Owner: University of Maryland

Scope: 1970–2020 (filtered subset)

📊 Summary of Findings

Nigeria accounts for 81% of attacks.

Boko Haram responsible for over 2,600 recorded incidents.

Private citizens most affected target type.

2018 recorded highest yearly attack count (919).

Urban centers (e.g., Maiduguri, Kano) are repeatedly targeted.

🔍 Methodology

All analysis was conducted in Microsoft Excel using:

Pivot Tables

Count and Summary Functions

Cross-tab Visualizations

Basic Filtering and Sorting

Data was cleaned to eliminate duplicates, handle null values, and group similar entries (e.g., suspected groups).

📌 Recommendations

Government

Invest in intelligence gathering to reduce “unknown” group attributions.

Prioritize security funding for urban centers under siege.

Humanitarian Agencies

Focus PTSD and trauma relief in top-affected cities.

Improve local response systems near border zones.

Research & Development

Build ML forecasting models for predicting attacks.

Conduct NLP sentiment analysis on threat reports.

🧪 Future Work

Time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)

Geospatial heatmap clustering

Integration with real-time feeds (e.g., ACLED, news APIs)
